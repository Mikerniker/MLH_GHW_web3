## Decentralized Charity Donation Tracker

### Overview
The Decentralized Charity Donation Tracker is a platform built with Solana that intends to enable users to track their donations and see how funds are utilized. The project aims to bring transparency and accountability to charitable donations, ensuring donors can see the impact of their contributions.

### Purpose
- **Transparency**: Provide users with detailed tracking of their donations.
- **Accountability**: Show how and where the funds are being used.

### Future Plans
While I still have some confusion around Rust, creating smart contracts, and using Anchor, I aim to deepen my knowledge in these areas. I plan to keep practicing and refining my skills to eventually build a fully functional dApp.
